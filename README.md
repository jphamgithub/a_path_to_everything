# How to read
I know you can read. You're here, but I've been at the top of long blocks of text before. I never thought I'd write one.

Change your perspective. Reading is hard, I get it. Firstly, stop. Go get Speechify and have it read this to you. On 2X or even 3X speed.

But really, I have been there. People write massive posts and sometimes these things get so long they get called books. Reading is hard, but not reading is going to be a lot more pain in the long term. The alternative is the writer just waits around and repeats themselves to hundreds of people.

Respect the author. Read. Learn. Writers put thousands of hours of thought into the things they write. Use technology Speechify/audible/blinkist, etc., and consume those thoughts. One day you'll get the chance to ask an insightful question instead of something that's been answered a million times before in the literature (cuz you read now!)

So please be a reader. You do not have to read this. I wrote this just to dump my life advice. If you skim, just a bit further you'll see I encourage you to read many people. Listen to many people. Form your own opinions and go have an amazing life.

"Smart people learn from their mistakes. Geniuses learn from other's mistakes. Reading is the most efficient portal to genius." -Possibly me/ but maybe someone else! I don't know who said it first!

Now on to reading...

The best advice is advice from 1,000+ people, sprinkled with common sense, and your own experience. Here I have tried to collect the 1,000+ influences in my life that have served me well from finance to tech to mindset.

# Life Advice for Tech, Fitness, Finance, and more.

Welcome to my repository where I share my insights and advice on breaking into the tech industry, leveraging apps for efficiency, staying fit, and managing finances. 

The worst thing in life is having no money, no friends, no family, and no purpose. It also kind of sucks to have just one of those things. So be balanced and do it all. One baby step at a time.

But again, combine this with 999 other people's advice and sprinkle in your own life experience. Fork this. Make a merge request. Add more!

## Mindset Tips
- You can do this. I grew up on welfare, no parents, and a lot of imposter syndrome. Hard work truly does beat natural talent. I've had a very non linear career.
- I haven't "made it." I am still on the journey, but I am sharing tips below that have taken me from a scarcity mindset to a growth mindset.
- Opportunity is out there. You need to take baby steps towards your dreams every day. With proper tools and technology these days. It has never been easier to make a daily dent in your goals.

Do you need a more formal version of this advice?

- **Embrace Your Journey**: Remember, everyone's path is unique. My journey, from welfare to overcoming imposter syndrome, proves that resilience and hard work can surpass inherent talent.
- **Celebrate Continuous Growth**: Success isn't a destination but a journey. I'm still on my path, sharing insights that helped me transition from a scarcity mindset to embracing growth and possibilities.
- **Take Daily Steps Towards Dreams**: In today's world, brimming with tools and technology, it's easier than ever to make small yet significant strides towards your goals every day. Embrace these resources and let them propel you forward.

Long story short, drink a tall glass of figure it the *** out. You have to want whatever your goal is, but I get it! It's lonely out there trying for something your friends might look down on. People don't always encourage you when you're doing well. 

Find new friends. Care less about what others think, and work towards what you know is right for you. And if you don't know what you want emulate those that inspire you and take baby steps in the right direction.

You don't know what career you want, but you know 80% of jobs involve computers. Learn about computers so you can either draw art on them or code on them. 

You don't know where you want to live, but you know it's not where you are. Go visit a place, any place. Learn and experience more. I used to be deadly afraid of a 20 minute drive down the road. Not actually afraid of driving, but how inefficient it might be to go to X place when I could stick with my old routine that got X thing done faster. Try something new. It could lead to an overall better life.

- **Why it's great**: Ideal for multitasking and consuming information while commuting or exercising.
  - You know when someone gives you some giant PDF to read, and you never do? This has changed the game for me. It is worth paying for. I have literally saved so much time just binging some white paper on 2X speed while driving.
  - I will say AIR PODS PRO are also a requirement. I live with these in my ears a big chunk of the day.

## Finance Tips

### Budgeting
- Budgeting Methods
  - Build a Lifetime budget. Yes you think I'm crazy, but I'm not.
      - Link to my lifetime budget calculator: <Pending>
      - There are so many decisions about how you plan to live your life, when you plan to retire, how much income you'd like to have. These assumptions are pivotal in terms of making smart decisions today.
      - It seems like a daunting task, but actually saves your hundreds if not years of working time.
      - It allows for things life work hiatuses, i.e. you planned your life and aim to save 20K per year. You can save 40K one year and take an entire year off!
      - <More details pending>

### Bloggers That Changed My Financial Life
  - I can't possibly write as good of information as the below bloggers who changed my life:
  - **[JL Collins](https://jlcollinsnh.com/)**: Imagine a financially savvy dad guiding you. His take on index funds simplifies investing. Key read: ["How I Failed My Daughter and a Simple Path to Wealth"](https://jlcollinsnh.com/2011/06/08/how-i-failed-my-daughter-and-a-simple-path-to-wealth/).

   - Buy simple index funds that's it!

## Fitness Advice
### Nutrition and Diet
- Nutrition is first up. If you don't get to the lifting part, good. I'd rather you digest this info on food if nothing else.
- Getting "fit". A fit mindset
    - I have been up and down with my weight in my life. Sometimes I had abs, other times I was very chunky with a nice round Asian face. 
- Recommended Apps for Diet Tracking
    - What is measured is managed. Learn to use myfitnesspal. Watch youtube videos on tips.
    - It is a lot easier to slow down and measure what you eat for a month or two and spend 5 minutes on data entry than HOURS on the treadmill.
    - You cannot outwork a bad diet.
    - Forget signing up for the gym.
    - Starting out, don't lift, don't run. Just go read food labels at the grocery store. Make 3-4 visit to grocery store per week for a few months.
    - Learn about food, enter the 40 most common things you eat in to myfitness pal. Learn the nuances of macros.
    - Learn that protein, fat, and carbs should simply be Energy Source 1, 2 and 3. Fat isn't whats making you fat. Neither is carbs or protein.
    - Over-eating, a bad relationship with food, and lack of understanding portions is what's killing you.
    - It will be hard. Running Daily WILL work short term.
    - Strength training is AMAZING.
    - But if you don't fix your relationship with food, you'll never figure it out.
    - Replacing one extreme (over-eating) with another extreme (over-working out) isn't the solution.
    - Search for balance.
- "Influencers" get a bad wrap. The word is kind of a joke, but some influencers rock. I haven't vetted EVERYTHING the below people post, but I can say at least a chunk of what they say is amazing.
    - People who say all the above better than I ever could:
        - Darren Liu: https://www.youtube.com/@Darrenliufitness
            - He emphasizes the simplicity of mobility 3-4 times a week for 10 minutes, plus strength training 4 times a week. He doesn't advocate or demonize running, but shows you how 5-10K steps a day and learning about food is all you need to be fit and healthy. Everything else is for personal victory if you want it. i.e. Marathon running, etc. I have done 2 marathons and a dozen half marathons. I have always done them from a negative place of "wanting to lose weight", and I think that is wrong. Just do it for fun. Learn balance in your every day life with food tips said prior.
        - Liam from the "theplantslant": https://www.tiktok.com/@theplantslant
            - I just love all the REAL food this guy posts with food you've seen before in real life. Super practical tips like Costco foods well balanced in protein/carbs/fat, etc to amazing cereal options and well balanced protein bars to just general food tips. He comes off kind of like an *** at first, but I learned to love his stuff.
        - Jacob Howeird: https://www.tiktok.com/@jacobhoweird
            - Sometimes you just want to eat a MOUNTAIN of food with low calories. This guy does it. Love his stuff.
            - Shout out to my favorite post of his with an amazing huge snack I have often:
              ```
              Pumpkin Pie
              170 grams of Greek yogurt fat free
              Libby's 100% pure pumpkin (122 grams)
              1/2 tablespoon Pumpkin Pie Spice
              2 packets of Stevia
              
              Weigh on food scale, Mix it all together, done.
              
              140 calories, 19 grams protein, 0.5 fat, 7 grams carbs
              
              
              Pudding Ice cream
              1.5 cups (12 oz) Fair life white regular Milk 13 g protein
              Chocolate Jello Sugar Free (3 servings 30g of sugar free chocolate pudding mix)
              
              Blend, Weight on food scale, Chill in fridge 5 minutes, eat
              
              150 calories, 19.5 g protein, 12.5 g carbs, 0 fat
              
              
              @jacobhoweird on tik tok
              
              https://www.tiktok.com/@jacobhoweird/video/7038057087791811845?is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1

              ```
          - Will Tennyson: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QXaAQMwfBI
            - Once you learn what you eat, the differences of macros in ground chicken and chicken breast or you learn how damn low calorie shrimp is... it's time to strength train.
            - You should watch Will Tennyson's video on survival guide at the gym: "Beginner's Gym Survival Guide"
            - Watch it, enjoy his jokes, and if it's confusing. Consider a coach. Accountability is the only thing that will... keep you accountable.

### Workout Routines
- OK so you're busy as F. Right? And you're kind of lazy? Well, I've done all the workouts imaginable. I did F45, Orange Theory. I did Army Basic training lol. I did a handful of marathons, and I did probably a half marathon every month for two years at one point. I ran 4-10 miles per day for many years. I did a lot of extremes. I wasn't balanced. The fitness industry is overwhelming. Absolutely overwhelming.
- I think you should keep it simple. Walk 10,000 steps per day. Lift 3-4 times a week. The way I think of it is this. You're busy.
- Routine 2
           
- Biking to work
  - I biked to work for 5 years in Boston and it was the best years.
  - This article kicked my ass to finally do it: https://semi-rad.com/2011/06/9-reasons-why-you-should-never-bike-to-work/
  - God forbid, you give up the 45 minutes of driving and visits to gym after work! How could you possibly avoid getting wet!
  - Isn't it cold outside?! People will ask! Jacket's haven't been invented yet!
  - Jokes aside.
      - Safety! People have died on bikes. I will say this. You have the option to get off roads on dangerous parts and be a pedestrian. In 5 years, I never put myself near large vehicles and I avoided narrow roads when conditions were not safe. I never once felt unsafe. 
  - But seriously, the 30-45 minutes on my bike, weaving through city traffic, listening to music, with the low hum of city chatter. It was a thrill. I hope to move back to biking to work. But for now, I am enjoying remote work and walking to the office when I need to go in. I understand it is not possible for most people. I am currently on a one year Army mobilization where I have to drive to work daily. In the past I had a 1.5 hour commute. Both times I just found time to walk at lunch. It takes effort to get outside and get your steps. But I have always found I'm more productive if I can be disciplined to get up and get sunlight. Do what you can, but if you have the chance to bike to work. Take it.



### Traveling

 - This post inspired mine! I thought why not give the code, the money tips, etc. What's a career without proper money management?!
 - I also thought why not use the amazing power of git and versioning to keep building on these tips over time. Hope people fork this/ merge request to it, etc. It is a living document.
